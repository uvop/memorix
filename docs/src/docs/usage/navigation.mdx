To add items on the sidebar, it's necessary you create a `sidebar.yml` file under the config folder. Example:

```yaml title=sidebar.yml
# Just a simple item
- label: 'Home'
  link: '/'
# With a list of items
- label: 'With subitems'
  items:
    - label: 'My Example'
      link: '/my-example'
```

If necessary, you can also add external links:

```yaml
- label: 'GitHub'
  link: 'https://github.com/jpedroschmitz'
```
